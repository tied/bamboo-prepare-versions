Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run -u 6.3.15 -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-mvn package   -- rebuild jar file and reload plugin in the running bamboo

* atlas-debug         -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-help          -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
